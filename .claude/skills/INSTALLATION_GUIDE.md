## File Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
Your Excel file should have at least one of these columns (any name variation works):
- Description field: "Description", "Short Description", "Summary", "Issue"
- Ticket ID: "Number", "Ticket ID", "Incident", "ID"

### Optional but Helpful
- Category: "Classification", "Category", "Type"
- Assignment: "Assignment Group", "Team"
- Dates: "Opened", "Closed", "Created"

**The skill is very flexible** - even with minimal columns, it will extract and categorize what's available.
