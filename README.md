### MCP Integration

This service supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and can be integrated with AI assistants and other MCP clients.

#### Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supportify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8787/mcp"]
    }
  }
}

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (serverless, edge computing)
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight web framework)
- **Parser**: Custom regex-based HTML parser (no duplication, high performance)
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol via HTTP transport

### How It Works

1. **Fetch**: Downloads HTML from Apple Support guide URLs
2. **Parse**: Extracts content using regex patterns targeting specific HTML structures
3. **Clean**: Removes navigation, ads, and duplicate elements
4. **Convert**: Transforms HTML to clean Markdown with proper formatting
5. **Serve**: Returns via HTTP API or MCP protocol

### Key Features

- **Intro Paragraph Extraction**: Captures opening content before sections
- **Section Parsing**: Extracts Subhead divs with headings and paragraphs
- **Link Preservation**: Converts relative URLs to absolute Apple Support links
- **Published Dates**: Includes document publication dates
- **Table Support**: Parses table content (e.g., declaration types in DDM)

## Content Quality

### Deployment Guide
- **257 topics** covering device management, enrollment, configuration, security
- **Example topics**: Declarative Device Management, Automated Enrollment, MDM, Setup Assistant
- **Content sizes**: 500 bytes (landing pages) to 6KB (detailed guides)

### Security Guide  
- **Comprehensive coverage** of Apple platform security architecture
- **Example topics**: Secure Enclave (21KB), FileVault (4KB), Face ID (4KB)
- **Detailed technical content** with architecture diagrams descriptions and specifications
