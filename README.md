# sosumi.ai

Making Apple docs AI-readable.

[sosumi.ai](https://sosumi.ai) 
provides Apple Developer documentation in an AI-readable format 
by converting JavaScript-rendered pages into Markdown.

## Usage

### HTTP API

Replace `developer.apple.com` with `sosumi.ai` 
in any Apple Developer documentation URL:

**Original:**
```
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array
```

**AI-readable:**
```
https://sosumi.ai/documentation/swift/array
```

### MCP Integration

Sosumi's MCP server supports Streamable HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport. 
If your client supports either of these, 
configure it to connect directly to `https://sosumi.ai/mcp`.

Otherwise,
you can run this command to proxy over stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sosumi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://sosumi.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [the website](https://sosumi.ai/#clients) for client-specific instructions.

#### Available Resources

- `doc://{path}` - Apple Developer documentation in Markdown format
  - Example: `doc://swift/array` returns Swift Array documentation

#### Available Tools

- `search` - Searches Apple Developer documentation
  - Parameters: `query` (string)
  - Returns structured results with titles, URLs, descriptions, breadcrumbs, and tags

- `fetch` - Fetches Apple Developer documentation by path
  - Parameters: `path` (string) - Full or relative documentation path (e.g., '/documentation/swift', 'swiftui/view')
  - Returns documentation content as Markdown

## Self-Hosting

This project is designed to be easily run on your own machine
or deployed to a hosting provider.

Sosumi.ai is currently hosted by 
[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nshipster/sosumi.ai.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Once the application is up and running, press the <kbd>b</kbd>
to open the URL in your browser.

To configure MCP clients to use your development server, 
replace `sosumi.ai` with the local server address
(`http://localhost:8787` by default).
