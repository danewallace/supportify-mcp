# Supportify MCP

Making Apple Support guides AI-readable.

This MCP server provides access to Apple Platform Security and Deployment guides in an AI-readable Markdown format by parsing the HTML content from Apple Support pages.

## Supported Guides

- **[Apple Platform Security Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web)** - Comprehensive guide on Apple platform security
- **[Apple Platform Deployment Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/welcome/web)** - Guide for deploying Apple devices in enterprise environments

## Usage

### HTTP API

Access support guide pages using the following URL pattern:

```
/guide/{guide-name}/{page-path}
```

**Examples:**
```
/guide/security/welcome
/guide/security/intro-to-apple-platform-security-seccd5016d31
/guide/deployment/welcome
```

The service returns the content as Markdown by default, or JSON if you include `Accept: application/json` in your request headers.

### MCP Integration

This service supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and can be integrated with AI assistants and other MCP clients.

#### Configuration
