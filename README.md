### Key Features

- **Intro Paragraph Extraction**: Captures opening content before sections
- **Section Parsing**: Extracts Subhead divs with headings and paragraphs
- **Link Preservation**: Converts relative URLs to absolute Apple Support links
- **Published Dates**: Includes document publication dates
- **Table Support**: Parses table content (e.g., declaration types in DDM)

## Content Quality

### Deployment Guide
- **257 topics** covering device management, enrollment, configuration, security
- **Example topics**: Declarative Device Management, Automated Enrollment, MDM, Setup Assistant
- **Content sizes**: 500 bytes (landing pages) to 6KB (detailed guides)

### Security Guide  
- **Comprehensive coverage** of Apple platform security architecture
- **Example topics**: Secure Enclave (21KB), FileVault (4KB), Face ID (4KB)
